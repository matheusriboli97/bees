## Project Description

- FOLDERS ORGANIZATION

- assets: Contain the images and icons used at the project
- components: Global components used at the application, usually in bigger projects for each page i make a new folder, but how it was a small project i've used just a global components folder
- context: A context used to manage the global states. I've used this context to show a chip that has messages to the user
- models: Used typescript, so i've used a folder to describe each interface
- pages: the core folder. Where the pages are developed. Each one contains an index and a style
- services: Where the connections to the server are made

- PACKAGES

- axios: To communicate with the server easily
- swc, testing library and jest: To make the tests ( Or try to :/ )

- GENERAL INFORMATION AND CHALLENGES

- The inline input was one of the most difficult projects, because it needs to deal with rerender, and that is really boring in React.
- Used Regex to see if the login page input has no invalid characters, but it was not a big deal
- Used Typescript because it helps in a lot of fields, as: Debugging, searching info, organization ...
- This was a really nice project to do, not so difficult, but enough to touch a lot of skills that a good developer needs to have.
